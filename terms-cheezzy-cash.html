By buying, loading, or using your Cheezzy Cash or Gift Card, you agree to these terms.</p>

<p>This Agreement includes an Arbitration provision that governs any disputes between you and us. This provision will:</p>

<p>● Eliminate your right to a trial by jury; and</p>

<p>● Substantially affect your rights, including preventing you from bringing, joining or participating in class or consolidated proceedings.</p>

<p>You agree that we may provide notices, disclosures and amendments to this Agreement, and other information relating to your Cheezzy Cash &amp; Gift Card by electronic means, including posting such materials online at this site or via email, SMS etc.</p>

<p>About Your Account</p>

<p>Cheezzy cash is basically your personal digital Gift Card whereas Cheezzy Gift Card is what you purchase to share with others to load into their accounts.</p>

<p>We issue the Cheezzy Cash Account to you. It allows you to load a Ghana cedis value onto your Cheezzy Cash Account for use at participating Cheezzy Pizza Branches. The Ghana cedi value that you load onto your Cheezzy Cash is a prepayment for specified goods and services of participating stores. We offer the Cheezzy Cash to make it easier for you to shop with us and to make your relationship with us more rewarding. Unless otherwise required by law or permitted by this Agreement, the Ghana Cedis value on your Cheezzy Cash and /or Gift Card is nonrefundable and may not be redeemed for cash. The value on your Cheezzy Cash is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), nor does it earn interest.</p>

<p>Cheezzy Cash are not targeted towards, nor intended for use by, anyone under the age of 13. If you are between the ages of 13 and 18, you may only use Cheezzy Cash or Gift Card under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by this Agreement.</p>

<p>When you register your Cheezzy Cash or Gift Card with the Cheezzy&reg; Rewards program, the Cheezzy&reg; Rewards terms of use which can be found at https://www.Cheezzy.com/ will also apply.</p>

<p><strong>Loading Value on Your Cheezzy Cash Account / Gift Card</strong></p>

<p>In Ghana, you can load value on your Cheezzy Cash Account by using our designated messaging platforms via Messenger or WhatsApp . There may be a delay from the time you pay the amount to be loaded onto your Cheezzy Cash Account or Gift Card and those funds being available for use.</p>

<p>You may not have more than GHc 500 in value on any of your Cheezzy Gift Card at any time, and no more than GHC 2,000 may be associated with any one Cheezzy Cash Accont in a single day. This means that the activity on any one of your Cheezzy Cash or Gift Card cannot exceed GHC 2,000 over the course of a day.</p>

<p>The total value you may load onto your Cheezzy Cash and/or all Gift Cards, together with the value of any new Cheezzy Gift Cards that you may purchase, may not exceed GHC10,000 on any given day. There is a minimum amount that you may load on any Cheezzy Cash or Gift Card at any given time, and that amount is typically GHc10. We may change any of these amounts at any time without notice to you.</p>

<p>If you use a credit or debit card or Mobile Money Account to purchase or reload your Cheezzy Cash, prior to charging your credit or debit Cash or Mobile Money, an authorization process will occur for the amount of your purchase or reload transaction (&quot;Transaction&quot;).</p>

<p>The authorization process will validate the credit or debit card or Mobile Money number, status, available credit or funds and billing information to ensure that it matches what the bank or cardcompany has on file.</p>

<p>Your bank or Cheezzy Pizza (Harvest Diversified) or Makalope Solutions may attempt to contact you for additional information prior to authorizing the Transaction amount.</p>

<p>For credit cards, once an authorization is received, you may notice a decrease in your available credit line. Your bank may hold this Ghana Cedi amount from your credit line or available balance for a short period of time determined by the policy of your bank before your Transaction is fulfilled. For debit cards or Mobile Money, your bank/ Mobile Money account may pre-authorize a charge to your deposit or checking account and place a temporary hold on the funds before your Transaction is fulfilled. Regardless of whether you use a credit, debit card or Mobile money, your card or mobile money account will be charged only upon fulfillment of your Transaction. If your Transaction is cancelled, Cheezzy will request an authorization reversal on your behalf. Reversal times may vary. We recommend contacting your mobile money service provider, bank or credit card company to learn about their authorization and authorization reversal policies.</p>

<p>All amounts loaded onto your Cheezzy Cash or Gift Cards are denominated in the currency of the country in which it was sold (the &quot;base currency&quot;). In the future, When you make a purchase in a different country, the Transaction total is converted from the currency of that country (the &quot;local currency&quot;) to the base currency and deducted from your Cheezzy Cash balance. No fees or other charges are made to your Cheezzy Cash for the currency conversion. However, note that your bank or card provider may charge you a separate fee if you are using a credit or debit card or other accepted payment method to load your Cheezzy Cash outside of Ghana. Cheezzy Pizza does not receive any portion of, and does not have any control over, any such fee. Although the actual balance of your Cheezzy Cash is kept in the base currency, the balance shown on your receipt will be in the local currency of the store location. Transactions that occur on our website are denominated in Ghana Cedis. Currency conversions are based on currency exchange rates applicable on the date of the Transaction.</p>

<p>You can reload your Cheezzy Cash online via our designated messaging platforms and reload either manually online when you choose or set up auto-reload. With automatic reload, you simply set the reload date or the balance at which you want to reload your Cheezzy Cash and provide us with payment information. We will send you an email confirming the automatic reload Transaction terms and bill your credit card or debit card according to the schedule and amount you have selected. We will also send you an email after each reload to let you know your Cheezzy Cash has been reloaded. You can change your reload preferences at any time, but changes may take up to twenty-four (24) hours to go into effect.</p>

<p>To discontinue the automatic reload feature, you must log-in to your Cheezzy account via Messenger or WhatsApp at least twenty-four (24) hours before the next scheduled reload. Once the Ghana cedis value is loaded, the Transaction cannot be reversed.</p>

<p><strong>Use of Cheezzy Gift Cards by Businesses</strong></p>

                <h2>Cheezzy Cash is your personal Digital Gift Card</h2>
                <p>Cheezzy Gift Card is what you purchase to share with others to load into their accounts</p>
                <p>We issue the Cheezzy Cash Account to you. It allows you to load a Ghana cedis value
                    onto your Cheezzy Cash Account for use at participating Cheezzy Pizza Branches.</p>
                 <p>The Ghana Cedi value that you load onto your Cheezzy Cash is a prepayment for specified
                    goods and services of participating stores.</p> 
                <p>We offer the Cheezzy Cash to make it easier for you to shop with us and to make your 
                    relationship with us more rewarding.</p>
                <h2>Loading Value on Your Cheezzy Cash Account / Gift Card</h2>    
                <p>In Ghana, you can load value on your Cheezzy Cash Account by using our designated
                    messaging platforms via Messenger or WhatsApp.</p>
                <p>There may be a delay from the time you pay the amount to be loaded onto your 
                    Cheezzy Cash Account or Gift Card and those funds being available for use.</p>
                <p>You may not have more than GHc 500 in value on any of your Cheezzy Gift Card at any
                    time, and no more than GHC 2,000 may be associated with any one Cheezzy Cash
                    Accont in a single day. This means that the activity on any one of your Cheezzy Cash or
                    Gift Card cannot exceed GHC 2,000 over the course of a day.</p> 
                <p>The total value you may
                    load onto your Cheezzy Cash and/or all Gift Cards, together with the value of any new
                    Cheezzy Gift Cards that you may purchase, may not exceed GHC10,000 on any given
                    day. There is a minimum amount that you may load on any Cheezzy Cash or Gift Card
                    at any given time, and that amount is typically GHc10. We may change any of these
                    amounts at any time without notice to you</p>
